Dynamic Model Routing Middleware

Analyzes task complexity and requirements to dynamically select the most appropriate
LLM model based on configurable strategies.

This enables cost optimization, performance optimization, or balanced approaches
by routing requests to different models based on task characteristics.

Usage:
    from core.middleware.routing import ModelRouter

    router = ModelRouter()
    selected_model = router.route(
        original_model="claude-haiku-4-5",
        context_length=5000,
        tool_count=10,
        strategy="cost_optimized"
    )

NOTE: Model routing is OPT-IN only. It must be explicitly enabled via
agent_config["enable_model_routing"] = True
