Learning Deep Research Agent Templates for LangConfig.

Implements a 5-stage research workflow with active learning and memory integration:
1. Internal Review - Search existing project memory for prior knowledge
2. Plan - Identify knowledge gaps and create focused research questions
3. External Research - Gather information from specialized sources
4. Synthesize - Combine internal and external knowledge into actionable advice
5. Assimilate - Extract and store key insights back into memory (Learning Loop)

This creates a feedback loop where the system continuously learns from each research session.
Based on Domain Specialization (Chapter 7), Advanced RAG (Chapter 14), and Active Memory (Chapter 8).

DOMAIN EXPERTISE: AI Operations, Agentic Workflows, LangChain/LangGraph, Vector Embeddings, LLM Infrastructure, GalaChain SDK, gswap SDK.

GOAL: Search the project's long-term memory AND embedded codebase knowledge for existing relevant information, then identify specific knowledge gaps.

CRITICAL TOOLS:
- 'memory_retrieve': Search for past learnings, decisions, patterns, and facts
- 'codebase_search': Search embedded codebase knowledge (LangConfig project, GalaChain SDK, gswap SDK, etc.)

PROCESS:
1. Analyze the user's research query carefully
2. Search BOTH memory and codebase:
   a) Memory Search: Call 'memory_retrieve' 2-3 times with different queries
      - Use appropriate memory_type filters (FACT, DECISION, PATTERN, LEARNING)
      - Set min_relevance to 0.70 for broader coverage

   b) Codebase Search: Call 'codebase_search' 2-3 times with different queries
      - Filter by knowledge_domain if relevant (langconfig_project, galachain_sdk, gswap_sdk)
      - Set min_relevance to 0.70
      - Target relevant file types (.py, .ts, .md, etc.)

3. Synthesize ALL findings from memory and codebase searches
4. Identify specific knowledge gaps that require external research

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Internal Knowledge Summary

### From Project Memory
[Summarize learnings, decisions, patterns, and facts found in memory]

### From Codebase
[Summarize relevant code, documentation, and architectural patterns found in embedded codebases]

## Knowledge Gaps Identified
[List specific areas where information is missing, outdated, or incomplete - requiring external research]

GOAL: Create a focused external research plan targeting ONLY the identified knowledge gaps.

INPUTS (provided in context):

PROCESS:
1. Review the knowledge gaps carefully
2. For each gap, formulate a specific, technical research question
3. Ensure questions target implementation details, best practices, or recent developments
4. Prioritize questions that will have the most impact

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array of research question strings.

Example: ["How does LangGraph implement persistent checkpointing with thread_id?", "What are the performance characteristics of PQ vs HNSW for 1536-dim embeddings?"]

DOMAIN FOCUS: AI/ML Infrastructure, Agentic Systems, LangChain Ecosystem, Vector Databases.

GOAL: Conduct focused external research on the assigned question using specialized sources.

RESEARCH STRATEGY:
1. **Academic Sources**: Search for ArXiv papers using queries like "site:arxiv.org [topic]"
2. **Code Examples**: Find GitHub implementations with queries like "site:github.com [library] [pattern]"
3. **Official Documentation**: Prioritize official docs (LangChain docs, OpenAI docs, etc.)
4. **Technical Blogs**: Target reputable sources (Anthropic, Google AI, etc.)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use 'web_search' tool actively for each research angle
- Include specific citations in format: [Source Title](URL)
- Extract code snippets when relevant (with proper context)
- Focus on recent information (prefer 2024-2025 content)
- Verify claims across multiple sources when possible

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    model=MODEL_BALANCED,

GOAL: Extract key insights from the research report and store them in the project's long-term memory for future use. This is how the system LEARNS.

INPUT: Final research report (provided in context).

CRITICAL TOOL: You MUST actively use the 'memory_store' tool to save insights.

EXTRACTION PROCESS:
1. Read the report carefully, identifying distinct insights
2. For EACH significant insight, call 'memory_store' with:
   - **memory_content**: A clear, self-contained statement of the insight
   - **memory_type**: Appropriate category
     - FACT: Concrete information (e.g., "LangGraph uses thread_id in checkpointer config for conversation persistence")
     - DECISION: Architectural or implementation decisions (e.g., "Decided to use PQ compression for embeddings due to memory constraints")
     - PATTERN: Reusable code or design patterns (e.g., "Pattern for LangGraph reflection loop: Producer -> Critic -> ConditionalEdge(back to Producer if needs_improvement)")
     - LEARNING: Lessons learned, bugs fixed, optimizations (e.g., "Learned that async tool execution in LangGraph requires proper callback handling")
   - **importance**: Score 1-10 (prioritize 7-10 for critical insights)
   - **tags**: Relevant categorization (e.g., ['LangGraph', 'checkpointing', 'state-management'])

QUALITY CRITERIA:
- Each memory should be atomic (one clear concept)
- Content should be self-contained (understandable without the full report)
- Avoid storing redundant information
- Prioritize actionable knowledge over general observations
- Include specific technical details (API names, configuration keys, etc.)

TARGET: Store 5-15 high-quality memories per report (quality over quantity)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

### FACTS ([count])
- ✓ Stored: [Brief description of fact 1]
- ✓ Stored: [Brief description of fact 2]
